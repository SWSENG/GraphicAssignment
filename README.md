# Tools
Firstly, we employed Visual Studio 2019, a software that facilitated code development and editing. This tool enabled us to create and manipulate code, allowing us to generate 2D and 3D representations of our robot and its weapon.

The second tool we utilized was the OpenGL API, a versatile application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D models. By integrating the OpenGL API library into Visual Studio, we were able to apply textures and lighting effects, resulting in a more realistic and captivating visual experience. Additionally, we incorporated the GLU library to assist with polygon rendering. For project documentation, we utilized Google Docs.

Furthermore, we leveraged GitHub as a repository for our project. GitHub's version control features allowed us to track code changes easily and facilitate collaboration among team members. We utilized features such as pull and push to merge code seamlessly.

Lastly, we utilized Paint to convert downloaded pictures from the .PNG format to .BMP. This conversion was necessary to apply texture images and enhance the realism of our robot in the game.

Overall, these tools collectively supported the development of our robot project, enabling us to create visually appealing and interactive experiences for our users.
